# PDBP
PDBP stands for **Pixel Display Boiler Plate**.

I wanted to make a CHIP8 emulator, using SDL2 to create the display. This class was the result.

Right now, you can specify the size of the display in pixels, as well as the size of the pixels themselves.

You can also draw pixels and rectangles on the display in RGB (alpha not supported yet).
